## Objectives and scope: ##



## Work performed during reporting period: ##
 
1. Purchased replacement iButtons and constructed sensors
2. Trained a student in the electrolyte leakage protocol
3. Downloaded data, reset temperature sensors, and collected soil moisture in the Guadalupe Mountains (Other two ranges planned for April)
4. Began work on converting metadata to EML format for existing data sets
5. Set up a private git repository on GitHub for the project, all scripts and csv data in version control.
6. Initiated plot/tree selection plan with Helen Poulos, finished tree location lists for the Guadalupes

## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##
 

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Finish spring maximum drought soil collection and reset temperature sensors in the Chisos and Davis Mountains (April 2014)
2. Run tree selection algorithm on plot data for Chisos and Davis Mountains
3. Visit and tag all trees in all mountain ranges (May-June)
4. Collect stems for xylem hydraulics work and measure (begin this work)
