Project Name:  *Predicting Sky Island Forest Vulnerability to Climate Change: Fine Scale Climate Variability, Drought Tolerance, and Fire Response*

| Principal Investigator  | Project Begin Date | Project End Date   | Institution |

## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. We finished the leaf protein analyses on oaks (Schwilk and Holaday). Schwilk completed preliminary analysis and data integrity checks.
2. We finished nearly all xylem vulnerability measurements. This was 7-days a week work for Schwilk and several students throughout June. We were able to solve all of the methodological problems that we faced last summer and the students are producing beautiful data now.
3. We made progress on the models of microclimate modeling over topography (Schwilk and Poulos). This is a priority for completion now that the main field work push is over. We have a GitHub repository for collaborative work on code and Poulos has begun adding to the preliminary codebase begun by Schwilk.
4. We submitted a manuscript on post fire plasticity in xylem vulnerability in oaks to *Plant Ecology*

## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

We had some equipment break, but were were able to procure replacements without much delay. No major problems.

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Finish microclimate models based on topography and local station daily data (Schwilk and Poulos). Build temperature prediction models.
3. Complete xylem vulnerability curves (Schwilk). This is nearly complete.
4. Write code for re-parameterized Weibull curve fitting for vulnerability curves, produce full trait matrix for species by mountain range.
5. Use results of (1) and (4) above to produce trait and climate niche models.  This will carry into early 2016.

 
## Budget expenditures: ##

This project contributed to the education of 5 undergraduate or recent graduate student researchers this quarter, 3 women and 4 from an underrepresented minority (Hispanic/Latino). This, assistantships for two graduate students who worked on the xylem vulnerability curves, and summer salary for Schwilk were the main expenditures.

List significant expenditures during this quarter (most have no fully posted)

| ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| PI Salaries and fringe               |   10383 |
| Undergraduate labor and fringe       |    3100 |
| Supplies and replacement parts       |     300 |
| Field site travel                    |     650 |
| Graduate RAs                         |    4700 |
|                                      |         |


Total expenses: $19133.  Some of these numbers are not final as getting my students paid correctly has been a nightmare at TTU.  I am estimating what the final costs should be.

## Interim results / deliverables: ##

1. We update the GitHub repository continuously with the raw data and the conductance results: https://github.com/schwilklab/CSC-sky-island-forest
2. Manuscript submitted: Schwilk, D.W., T.E. Brown, R. Lackey and J. Willms. "Post-fire resprouting oaks (genus: Quercus) exhibit plasticity in xylem vulnerability to drought." Submitted to *Plant Ecology* on June 30 2015.
