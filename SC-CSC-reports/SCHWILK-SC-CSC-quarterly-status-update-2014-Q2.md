## Objectives and scope: ##

The specific objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##
 
1. Downloaded data, reset temperature sensors, and collected soil moisture in Davis Mountains and in the Chisos Mountains (April).
2. Finalized tree and plot selection plan for all three ranges. Wrote scripts to convert coordinates, select plots (Schwilk and Poulos).
3. Trained a student in leaf collection and planned summer leaf collection plan, C:N analysis plan and leaf protein analyses
4. Rebuilt and modified hydraulic conductivity apparatus
5. Made leaf and stem collection trips to each range once in June. Tagged trees and collected leaves for approximately 1/2 of needed trees in each range.
6. Sorted and prepped leaves from each trip, collected leaf areas and weights on "C:N leaves" and stored "protein leaves" in the -20C freezer.
7. Began vulnerability curve measurements on stems collected.
8. Modified our air-injection system for vulnerability curves (see problems, below)

## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

We ran into a few unforeseen problems in the vulnerability curve method:

1. Curves are going slower than anticipated. This is in part a labor shortage issue. 
2. The pines are sometimes being damaged by the centrifuge method. We are exploring fixes and we also began using air-injection method. After modifying gaskets, we are having success with air injection. But this method is slower than the centrifuge.

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Finish tagging all trees and collecting one full leaf data set (1-2 more trips to each mountain range)
2. Finish vulnerability curve measurements on as many stems as possible this summer and early fall. This work will continue next season as well.
3. Create microclimate models based on topography and local station daily data (Schwilk and Poulos)
4. Run statistical climate downscaling to weather stations (Stoner)
5. Run C:N analyses on summer leaves for all trees

## Interim results / deliverables: ##

None. Project started in late February. We update the GitHub repository continuously with the raw data and the conductance results but have undertaken no analysis on the trait data.
