## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. We successfully implemented the complete spatial and temporal decomposition of microclimate data using PCA
2. Schwilk begain work on porting code to supercomputer cluster to run full landscape decompistion.
3. We completed dismantling iButton sensors in the Guadalupe Mountains


## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

None

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Finish removing iButtons sensors from the Chisos Mountains
2. Get PCA decomposition and reconstruction running on TTU supercomputer cluster.
 
## Budget expenditures: ##

This project contributed to the education of 2 graduate students and 1 undergraduate student researcher.
