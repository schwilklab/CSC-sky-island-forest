## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. Helen Poulos and Schwilk reconsidered spatial microclimate models to use
   boosted regression trees. Predictions of climate PCA loadings are now
   satisfactory.


## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

None

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Work on PCA historical reference period reconstructions.
 
## Budget expenditures: ##


List significant expenditures during this quarter.

None. Budget period over.
