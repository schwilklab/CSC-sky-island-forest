## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. We ground all leaf samples and finished prep for C:N and isotope analyses. (Schwilk, Holaday and students)
2. We sent out the samples for elemental analyses and have that data entered and have conducted preliminary graphical analyses (Schwilk and Holaday)
3. We began leaf protein measurements (Schwilk and Holaday). We plan to complete these by the end of April.
4. We created all derived topographical variables and GIS layers (Poulos). We ran principle components analyses on topographic variables and began gradient forest modeling (Poulos and Schwilk).


## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

No major problems.

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Create microclimate models based on topography and local station daily data (Schwilk and Poulos). Started.
2. Finish leaf protein extractions.
3. Reset iButtons in Chisos, Guadalupe and Davis Mountains.
4. Plan summer field season

 
## Budget expenditures: ##

This project contributed to the education of 3 undergraduate student researchers this quarter, all women and two from an underrepresented minority.  This semester, all elected to take research credits, so were not paid from the grant. But they will be taking paid work again in the summer.

## Interim results / deliverables: ##

1. We update the GitHub repository continuously with the raw data and the conductance results.
2. Undergrad student Tailor Brown is taking the lead on a ms we are preparing for submission: sBrown, T.E, J. Willms, R. Lackey, and D.W. Schwilk. "Xylem vulnerability to drought greater in post fire resprout oaks than in adults in a Chihuahuan desert sky-island".
