## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1.We finished tagging all trees and collecting one full leaf data set across all mountain ranges. This required two more trips to each range and a third trip to one. (Schwilk and students)
1. We ground all leaf samples and began prep for C:N and isotope analyses. (Schwilk and students)
2. We collected leaf trait data on 254 individual trees over the three mountain ranges. We were able to sample ten individuals per species per mountain range in which that species occurred for all but a couple of species. (Schwilk and students)
3.We created xylem vulnerability curves on 11 species. We attempted curves on 34 individuals total. (Schwilk and students)
3. We conducted the statistical climate downscaling to weather stations (Stoner). That data is now ready for use with the niche modeling projections once those are completed.
4. We searched the literature and developed a plan for using topographic variables in microclimate modeling.

## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

As detailed in the 2014 Q2 report, we ran into a few unforeseen problems in the vulnerability curve methods, but we were able to finish a reasonable number of curves and we foresee obtaining at least 5 curves per species by the end of the next season.

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Create microclimate models based on topography and local station daily data (Schwilk and Poulos). Helen and I have discussed topographic variables and decided on the list of calculations to conduct. Helen is creating the needed GIS layers this month.
2. Run C:N analyses on summer leaves for all trees
3. Begin leaf protein anlaysis on frozen subsamples.
 
## Budget expenditures: ##

This project partially funded five undergraduate student researchers, all women and two from an underrepresented minority.

I was able to save a significant amount on student labor this summer because the student who conducted the majority of the xylem hydraulics work (Tailor Brown) was accepted into the Howard Hughes Medical Institute research scholar program and was paid out of that project full time for her work on this which she is using as an independent research project. Two other students decided to take credit hours for some of this work. We did have some unforeseen expenses because we needed to repair a damaged bolt in the mount of the Sorvall centrifuge w use in our xylem hydraulics work.

List significant expenditures during this quarter

| Type                                 | Expense |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Labor (students)                     | $ 967   |
| Stem/leaf collection materials       | $ 380   |
| Supplies and parts for xylem hydr.   | $ 795   |
| Field site travel and lodging        | $ 1121  |

Total expenses: $3263

## Interim results / deliverables: ##

1. The downscaled climate data projections completed this summer are an interim product.
2. We update the GitHub repository continuously with the raw data and the conductance results.
