Project Name:  *Predicting Sky Island Forest Vulnerability to Climate Change: Fine Scale Climate Variability, Drought Tolerance, and Fire Response*

## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. We finished the bulk of leaf protein analyses on oaks (Schwilk and Holaday). We will finish the remainder by early May 2015. This has been a significant amount of work.
2. We began creating the GAM models of microclimate modeling over topography (Schwilk and Poulos). Our exploration of the data and research of the literature suggests that GAM will be preferable to gradient forests.
3. We downloaded existing data and reset the iButton temperature sensors in all three mountain ranges. We are beginning to have failures of these sensors but have replaced those that failed.
4. Schwilk has begin interviewing undergraduates for summer field work.

## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

No major problems.

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Finish microclimate models based on topography and local station daily data (Schwilk and Poulos). Build temperature prediction models.
2. Finish leaf protein extractions.
3. Collect stems from all three ranges and complete xylem vulnerability curves (Schwilk). This is planned for June-July 2015.
4. Finish manuscript on resprout vs adult oak xylem vulnerability for submission to Plant Ecology by June (lead author is undergraduate, Tailor Brown.)

 
## Budget expenditures: ##

This project contributed to the education of 3 undergraduate student researchers this quarter, all women and two from an underrepresented minority. This semester, all elected to take research credits, so were not paid from the grant. But one will be taking paid work again in the summer.

Total expenses: $7,104

## Interim results / deliverables: ##

1. We update the GitHub repository continuously with the raw data and the conductance results: https://github.com/schwilklab/CSC-sky-island-forest
2. Undergrad student Tailor Brown is taking the lead on a manuscript we are preparing for submission: Brown, T.E, J. Willms, R. Lackey, and D.W. Schwilk. "Xylem vulnerability to drought greater in post fire resprout oaks than in adults in a Chihuahuan desert sky-island". We aim to submit this to Plant Ecology by June 2015.
