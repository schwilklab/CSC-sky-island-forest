## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. We completed calculations of DEM derived variables

2. We completed dismantling iButton sensors in the Davis Mountains.


## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

None

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Finish removing iButtons sensors from each mountain range
2. Finish microclimate models based on topography and local station daily data. This will require gradient-forest models on topographic data and nested linear models on temporal component of PCA decomposition.
3. We repaired and replaced worn out field equipment.
 
## Budget expenditures: ##

This project contributed to the education of 3 undergraduate student researchers this quarter, 1 from an underrepresented minority (Hispanic/Latino).
