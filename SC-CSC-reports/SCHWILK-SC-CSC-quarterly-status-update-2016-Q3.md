## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. Removed last remaining iButton temperature sensors and repaired all equipment used
2. Began work on models predicting spatial and temporal components to the microclimate decomposition.


## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

None

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Finalize temporal and spatial prediction, begin code to use these predictions to reconstruct historical climate time series acorss the full landscapes and to reconstruct future projected climates by mountain range, GCM, and climate scenario (rcp45 and rcp85).
 
## Budget expenditures: ##

This project contributed to the education of 2 graduate students and 1 undergraduate student researcher.
