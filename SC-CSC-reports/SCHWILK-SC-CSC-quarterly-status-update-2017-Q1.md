## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. We recreated all spatial and temporal models, built system for saving results. Schwilk worked on getting reconstructions to run on TTU' s new supercomputer cluster, quanah. Some additional work needed in parallelizing code, but Schwilk had a heavy teaching load this semester.


## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

None

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Finish climate reconstruction code parallelization (Schwilk), begin work on species distribution models absed on these reconstructions (Poulos).
 
## Budget expenditures: ##

List significant expenditures during this quarter.
None. Budget period over.

This project contributed to the education of 1 undergraduate student researcher.
