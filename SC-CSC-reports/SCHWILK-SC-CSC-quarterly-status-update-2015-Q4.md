Quarterly Status Update:  October - December, 2015
====================================================

Project Name:  *Predicting Sky Island Forest Vulnerability to Climate Change: Fine Scale Climate Variability, Drought Tolerance, and Fire Response*

| Principal Investigator  | Project Begin Date | Project End Date   | Institution |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------- |

## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. Helen Poulos computed all DEM-derived topographic variables, but we found some errors and inconsistencies. Schwilk developed set of data quality control scripts and we began recalculating. We have the model fitting working, but now are rechecking the data that feeds the models.

2. Our manuscript submitted to *Plant Ecology* was accepted.

3. We began visting each mountain range to take down the iButton sensors


## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

Data cehcks and problems in DEM-derived variables as described in issues on github. See https://github.com/schwilklab/skyisland-climate/issues

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Finish removing iButtons sensors from each mountain range
2. Finish microclimate models based on topography and local station daily data.
 
## Budget expenditures: ##

This project contributed to the education of 5 undergraduate or recent graduate student researchers this quarter, 3 women and 4 from an underrepresented minority (Hispanic/Latino). This, assistantships for two graduate students who worked on the xylem vulnerability curves, and summer salary for Schwilk were the main expenditures.
