## Objectives and scope: ##

The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the key functional traits influencing contemporary distributions and environmental affinities of keystone forest tree species (oaks, pines and junipers) in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in western Texas, including the Guadalupe Mountains, the Davis Mountains, and the Chisos Mountains; 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and use these to conduct fine-scale climate downscaling (to 3m DEM) across three replicated mountain ranges that host important US Department of Interior and private forest resources; and thereby 3) predict how species and trait distributions might shift under future warmer and drier climates.

## Work performed during reporting period: ##

1. Solved coding challenges to get historical climate reconstructions to run (parallel matrix implementation, splitting landscape data, etc). The historical reconstructions are running on the new TTU cluster


## Problems encountered during reporting period: ##

None

## Work planned for next reporting period: ##

1. Split projected climate reconstructions by GCM scenario and future decade so that reconstructions will fit in memory and run within the 48 hour maximum allowed process time on TTU supercomputer cluster.
 
## Budget expenditures: ##

List significant expenditures during this quarter.

None. Budget period over.

This project contributed to the education of 1 undergraduate student researcher.
